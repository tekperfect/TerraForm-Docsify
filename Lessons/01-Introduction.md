## üèÜ Learning Objectives

By the end of this, you'll be able to...

1. Navigate Terraform Documentation
1. Understand the basics of IaaC

## üìñ Terraform

### Why Terraform?

* replication of infrastructure
* managment of said infrastructure
* shift from a Dev to Prod enviroment
* Declerative

### What is Terraform
**First and fore most Terraform is an IaaC**

IaaC or Infrastructure as a Code, is the same as a programmable infrastructure. tl;dr IaaC are ways to  manipulate and or create parts of infrastructure e.g. load balancers, security, and networks via a source code

As an Iaac, Terraform is a DevOps tool to automate and manage the infrastructure of your product and the services that run within your product; However Terraform is main feature is an infrastructure provsioning tool.

> You can say it's the Docker of infrastructure, as they are both a declerative language [defining the desirted end results ex. We want 5 servers with these set of perms]


### Installation
> The following instruction are for Unix compatiable systems like Ubuntu, otherwise follow [This](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

If you have a package manager like brew I suggest you use it! make sure you have awscli as well!

```bash
brew install terraform
```

Verify the installation with

```bash
sudo terraform -v
```

After I will suggest to install the appropiate terraform linter to your edtitor, I am using VScode, so I will use this [extenstion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform)

We will working with v0.12+ compatable requirements, so make sure you have at least v0.12 of the terraform cli

## ‚úçÔ∏è Practice

Look over the rescourse and documents to get a better understanding of IaaCs and terraform
